To get the runtime nav mesh working on your project you need:

1) To import the NavMeshComponentsPackage into your Unity project.
2) Set a NavMeshSurface object in your scene:
	1. Create an empty Object
	2. Add the component NavMeshSurface
3) Make sure your terrain and objects that are going to be included in the NavMesh are static.
4) Objects which are obstacles or which will be part of the NavMesh at the beginning, but will be destroyed later, need to have a component called NavMeshObstacle.
	- If the NavMeshObstacle will be affecting the NavMesh it will need the "Carve" box ticked. 
	- If the obstacle will only affect the terrain when it is not moving tick: Carve Only Stationary.
5) After you have created your world, on the same script:
	1. Create a variable NavMeshSurface surface.
	2. Get a reference to the NavMeshSurface by:
		- Getting it directly from the scene by making it: [SerializedField]; OR
		- Finding the object on the Start() function: surface = FindObjectOfType<NavMeshSurface>();
	3. Call surface.BuildNavMesh() *after* your world has been created.
